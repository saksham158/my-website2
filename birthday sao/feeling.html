            I made this for you as a small gift to remind you how special you are. Even though things have changed between us, I still carry a lot of feelings in my heart. Youâ€™ve always had a unique place in my life, and that hasnâ€™t gone away. I know youâ€™re with someone now, and I truly wish you happiness. I just wanted to be honest and let you know that a part of me still cares deeply. This gift isnâ€™t to change anythingâ€”itâ€™s just something from the heart, to celebrate you and everything you mean to me. This is what can i do for you from india but i want to do more for you but things changed . You Love Martin and i respect both of you i promissed i never come btw both of you. BUT once again never forget that i have pure feelings for you .     I MISS YOU      ND     I LIKE YOU"
